In this project, in the file *movies.py* I created some classes to use in the project. The classes: Video, Movie and Series. If you want to understande more about the classes you just need to access its docstrings.  

In the file *mindstorms.py* i just instanciated some objetcs of the Movie class to populate the HTML page generated at the end of the project.  

The file *fresh_tomatoes.py* was created by the Udacity Team and I just added some personalization to the file.
